This is a final project provided by my team in the Data Science Academy COMPFEST 12 titled "Moral Incentives in Credit Card Debt Repayment: Evidence from a Field Experiment".
The folder consists of EDA.ipynb and Modelling.ipynb for source code, dataset, and paper. You have to understand the paper comprehensively to get the sense of the project. 
Thanks for your credit on me.
